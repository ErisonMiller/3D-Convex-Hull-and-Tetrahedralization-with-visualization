# 3D Convex Hull and Tetrahedralization with visualization

### Assignment from the Computational Geometry class in UFC(Federal University of Cear√°)

In this project we have:
* An OpenGL 3D visualizer
* An .obj loader
* Convex Hull implementation
* Tetrahedralization implementation

___

### View Control
* Left mouse to rotate
* Right mouse to zoom in and out
* L to load obj
* Q and W to change tetrahedron size
* O to show original
* H to show Hull
* T to show Tetrahedralization
